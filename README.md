In this assignment you are going to write an essay. The essay should be approximately 750 words.

First go to <a href="https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai20contents.php">https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai20contents.php</a><a href="https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai20contents.php">.</a> There you’ll see the entire contents of the page listed but we’re only interested in the following (viz. AAAI Technical Tracks No. 1 through No. 7):

</ul>

Now, pick a paper from one of these technical tracks that you find both interesting and valuable.

Your essay must first summarize (needless to say, in your <u>own</u> words) what the paper is all about. Do this in clear, understandable, and informative sentences. Then you should review the paper. This means that you should explain, again in clear terms and using a good argument, why you <u>like</u> this article and why you think it is a <u>noteworthy</u> addition to the AI literature.

State the <u>word count</u> at the very end of your essay. Your essay should <u>not</u> have a title. Instead, it should specify the title, authors, and the DOI of the paper you’ve read, e.g.,

<h1>An Empirical Study of Content Understanding in Conversational Question Answering</h1>

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i05.6257">https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i05.6257</a>

(BTW, this stuff should <u>not</u> be included in the word count.) You must also submit the pdf of the paper along with your essay and <u>highlight</u> on it with a yellow brush the portions you regard especially important.
